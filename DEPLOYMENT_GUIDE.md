# üöÄ Gizli Deployment Guide

## Quick Start Options

### 1. üì± PWA (Progressive Web App) - **RECOMMENDED**
Your app is **already PWA-ready**! Users can install it directly from their browser:

#### Installation for Users:
- **Android (Chrome/Edge)**: Visit your hosted URL ‚Üí Menu ‚Üí "Add to Home screen"
- **iOS (Safari)**: Visit your hosted URL ‚Üí Share ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"

#### Current Status: ‚úÖ READY
- Service Worker: ‚úÖ Configured
- Web Manifest: ‚úÖ Configured  
- Offline Support: ‚úÖ Working
- Push Notifications: ‚úÖ Ready

### 2. üì¶ Native Mobile Apps (Android/iOS)

#### Android Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Build and open Android Studio
npm run mobile:android

# 2. In Android Studio:
# - Connect your Android device
# - Enable USB Debugging
# - Click "Run" to install on device
```

#### iOS Development Setup (macOS only)
```bash
# 1. Add iOS platform
npx cap add ios

# 2. Build and open Xcode
npm run mobile:ios

# 3. In Xcode:
# - Select your team/signing certificate
# - Connect your iOS device
# - Click "Run" to install on device
```

## üåê Production Hosting Options

### Option A: Static Hosting (Simple)
**Best for**: Testing, small deployments

**Platforms**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy the 'dist' folder to your chosen platform
```

### Option B: Full Stack Hosting (Complete)
**Best for**: Production use with signaling server

**Platforms**: Railway, Render, Heroku, DigitalOcean

1. **Deploy Backend** (server/index.ts)
2. **Deploy Frontend** (dist folder)
3. **Update environment variables**

---

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Development
```bash
# Start both servers locally
npm start

# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:3001
```

### Production
Update your environment variables:
```env
VITE_SIGNALING_SERVER_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
PORT=3001
```

---

## üì± Mobile App Store Deployment

### Google Play Store (Android)
```bash
# 1. Build release version
npm run build
npx cap sync android

# 2. Open Android Studio
npx cap open android

# 3. In Android Studio:
# - Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle/APK
# - Choose "Android App Bundle"
# - Upload to Google Play Console
```

**Important**: Google Play may have restrictions on encryption apps. Consider:
- Educational/research purpose emphasis
- Open source nature highlighting
- Compliance documentation

### Apple App Store (iOS)
```bash
# 1. Build release version (macOS only)
npm run build
npx cap sync ios

# 2. Open Xcode
npx cap open ios

# 3. In Xcode:
# - Select your team
# - Archive the app
# - Upload to App Store Connect
```

**Important**: App Store may reject strong encryption apps. Consider:
- Export compliance documentation
- Educational purpose emphasis
- Terms of service clarity

## üîí Security Considerations for Deployment

### 1. HTTPS Only
- **Required** for PWA and WebRTC
- Use certificates from Let's Encrypt or your hosting provider

### 2. Content Security Policy
Add to your index.html:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  connect-src 'self' wss: ws:;
  media-src 'self' blob:;
">
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Never expose sensitive keys:
```bash
# .env (not committed to git)
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_SIGNALING_SERVER_URL=https://your-server.com
```

### 4. Server Security
Your signaling server includes:
- ‚úÖ Helmet.js for security headers
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting ready

## üöÄ Automated Deployment Scripts

### GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
name: Deploy Gizli
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm run build
    - run: npm run mobile:deploy:android
```

### Quick Deploy Commands
```bash
# PWA deployment
npm run build
# Upload 'dist' folder to your hosting service

# Android APK
npm run mobile:deploy:android
# Find APK in: android/app/build/outputs/apk/

# iOS Archive
npm run mobile:deploy:ios
# Open Xcode and archive for App Store
```
